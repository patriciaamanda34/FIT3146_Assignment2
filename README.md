FIT3146 Assignment 2 Source Code - for the Website.

It is meant to play videos when clicked, as well as sending serial signals to Arduino and Micro:Bits depending on what's needed. The project itself is a diorama of the Legend of Prambanan Temple folklore, an Indonesian folklore. When certain buttons on the website is clicked, the Arduino (which are controlling the lights of the diorama) and the Micro:Bits (controlling the micro servos of the diorama) will react accordingly.
